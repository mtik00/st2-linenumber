st2-linenumber
==============

A Sublime Text 2 plug-in to replace currently selected text w/ current line number.
This can be useful in certain cases when you want to print something to the screen
and the interpreter doesn't have the concept of line number (e.g. executing `bash`
without extra parameters).

Install
=======
Download the python script, and put it in your Package folder.

Usage
=====
Highlight some text, or place a cursor where you want the line number inserted
(multiple selections are supported).  Run the command "Replace With Line Number".

Presto!
